- name: Soft Robotic Skin
  description:
    - point: Developed and optimized a neuromorphic architecture for printable organic neurons used in a Soft Robotic Skin with zero negative weights constrain.
    - point: I was majorly involved in developing the Neural Network algorithm and testing the electrical neurons. The ANN was physically implemented, tested and verified.

  used:
    - thing: Pytorch
    - thing: TensorFlow
    - thing: PSpice
    - thing: Matlab

- name: Autonomous RC Car
  description:
    - point: Built and Programmed a R/C race car to navigate the halls of a generated map at extreme speeds autonomously in a rally race.
    - point: Utilized AMCL in ROS to acquire the IMU data and the Hokuyo LIDAR to localize ourselves in a known map
    - point: Finished 3rd in KNOY 500 race.
  used:
    - thing: ROS
    - thing: Matlab
    - thing: LIDAR and IMU Intergration



- name: Protein Bioinformatics

  description:
    - point: Drug Delivery Enhancement method using Electric pulses for breast cancer cells
    - point: Optimized the electric field strength and pulse duration to increase the drug permeability in breast cancer cells.
    - point: performed multiple label-free quantitative proteomics studies on various drugs and analyzed over 30,000 proteins and genes to study the mechanism of action
